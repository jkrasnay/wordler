== Installation

* Copy the `wordler` script and the `words` list to a directory on your local disk

== Usage

Run Wordler after making each guess, providing all your guesses and their
results. Wordler will list words that are compatible with the results for your
guesses.

For example, suppose you guess TRAIN and Wordle gives you a green
square for the R and a yellow square for the N. Provide this to Wordler as
follows, using 0 in the position where there's a grey square, 1 in the position
where there's a yellow square, and 2 where there's a green square:

----
bb wordler train 02001
----

For each subsequent guess, repeat the command but with the new guess added:

----
bb wordler train 02001 drunk 22020
----
