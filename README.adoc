= Wordler - Wordle Helper

Utility to help with your link:https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/[Wordle] guesses.

== Installation

These installation instructions are for MacOS. The instructions should work for
Linux but you may need to change the script to point to your distribution's
`words` file.

* Install link:https://babashka.org/[Babashka]
* Copy the `wordler` script to your local disk
* Make the script executable: `chmod +x wordler`

== Usage

Run Wordler after making each guess, providing all your guesses and their
results. For example, suppose you guess TRAIN and Wordle gives you a green
square for the R and a yellow square for the N. Provide this to wordler as
follows, using 0 in the position where there's a grey square, 1 in the position
where there's a yellow square, and 2 where there's a green square:

----
./wordler train 02001
----

For each subsequent guess, repeat the command but with the new guess added:

----
./wordler train 02001 drunk 22020
----
